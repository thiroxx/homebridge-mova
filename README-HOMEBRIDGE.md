Homebridge plugin for exposing a supported MOVA robot vacuum to Apple Home as
a native Matter robotic vacuum cleaner.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an early, community-maintained release. It is not affiliated with or
> endorsed by MOVA. The MOVA cloud interface may change without notice.

## Supported devices

The plugin has been developed and tested with the **MOVA E40 Ultra** using the
device models `mova.vacuum.r9504a` and `mova.vacuum.r5732a`. Other MOVA models
are not currently supported.

## Features

- Native Matter robotic vacuum cleaner in Apple Home
- Start cleaning, pause, resume and return to the dock
- Live operational and battery status
- Vacuum, mop, vacuum-and-mop and sequential cleaning modes
- Automatic per-room cleaning with the settings saved in the MOVA app
- Selection of one or multiple rooms from the saved MOVA map
- Experimental ordered cleaning presets with per-room power, water and repeat
  settings

## Requirements

- Homebridge 2.0 or later with Matter support
- Node.js 22 or later
- A supported MOVA vacuum connected to a MOVAhome account
- An active internet connection to the MOVA cloud

## Installation

Install **Homebridge MOVA** from the Homebridge UI, or install it from npm:

```shell
npm install -g homebridge-mova
```

## Configuration

Use the Homebridge plugin settings and enter:

- **Name:** the name of the integration in Homebridge
- **MOVA email address:** the address used by the MOVAhome app
- **MOVA password:** the password for the MOVAhome account

Equivalent configuration:

```json
{
  "platform": "MovaVacuum",
  "name": "MOVA",
  "username": "your-mova-email@example.com",
  "password": "your-mova-password"
}
```

Run the plugin as a child bridge. Without cleaning presets, the recommended
setup is **Matter externals-only mode** with HAP disabled. In the stored bridge
configuration, `matter.enabled` is `false`, `matter.externalsOnly` is `true`
and `hap.enabled` is `false`. When presets are configured, keep Matter in
externals-only mode but enable HAP so Homebridge can publish their switches.

Restart Homebridge after saving the configuration. Homebridge publishes the
vacuum as a separate external Matter accessory. Open the plugin actions and
select **External Accessories** to display the vacuum's Matter QR code. Add the
code labelled with the vacuum's name to Apple Home rather than a generic
child-bridge code.

Homebridge may display **Matter not enabled** for the MOVA child bridge in this
configuration. This is expected: the child bridge's own Matter node is disabled,
while the external Matter vacuum remains active.

### Updating from 0.1.0

Version 1.0.0 changes the Homebridge registration from an accessory plugin to a
platform plugin so Matter can run inside a child bridge. Remove the old
`"accessory": "MovaVacuum"` configuration before installing the update, then
create the MOVA configuration again through the Homebridge UI. Do not copy an
old password from logs or support messages; enter the current password directly
in the protected password field.

Never include your MOVA password, Matter pairing code or complete Homebridge
configuration in an issue or support request.

## Room selection

When a saved MOVA map is available, its rooms are exposed through Matter's
Service Area feature. Select one or more rooms in Apple Home before starting
the vacuum. Starting without a room selection performs a complete cleaning.

To retain the individual cleaning mode configured for each room in the MOVA
app, select **Vacuum and Mop** and then **Automatic** in Apple Home. Apple Home
groups the Automatic option below Vacuum and Mop; Automatic still means that
the plugin applies each room's own MOVA setting. For example, a selected room
configured as vacuum-only remains vacuum-only while another selected room can
vacuum and mop in the same run.

Before an automatic room run, the plugin enables customized cleaning and waits
for the vacuum to confirm that mode. The vacuum then applies the room settings
currently saved in the MOVA app.

Choosing Vacuum, Mop, Vacuum and Mop or sequential cleaning without Automatic
intentionally applies that one mode to every selected room.

## Experimental cleaning presets

Version 1.1.0 alpha adds optional cleaning presets. Open the plugin settings,
load the rooms from the MOVA account and create one or more presets. Rooms can
be moved up or down to define their cleaning order. The command also encodes
a suction level, water volume and repeat count for every room. This is an alpha
feature because the MOVA firmware may apply some of those values globally.

The preset's **individual MOVA room settings** mode retains the cleaning type
saved for each room in the MOVA app. The other preset modes intentionally use
one cleaning type for every room in that preset.

Preset buttons are HAP accessories, while the vacuum itself remains a native
Matter accessory. Enable HAP for the MOVA child bridge and pair its HomeKit
code in addition to the vacuum's Matter code. Each preset then appears as a
separate momentary switch in Apple Home and can be used with Siri, scenes and
automations.

This interface is experimental. Confirm the room order and cleaning settings
with a short supervised run before using a new preset unattended.

## Troubleshooting

If the vacuum does not appear, check the Homebridge log for the MOVA cloud
connection, the selected device model and Matter publication. The Homebridge
host and the Apple Home hub must be reachable on the same local network for
Matter commissioning.

When reporting a problem, include the Homebridge version, Node.js version,
MOVA model identifier and relevant sanitized log lines.
