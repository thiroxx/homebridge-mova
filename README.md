# Homebridge MOVA

[![verified-by-homebridge](https://img.shields.io/badge/homebridge-verified-blueviolet?color=%23491F59&style=for-the-badge&logoColor=%23FFFFFF&logo=homebridge)](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Verified-Plugins)

Homebridge plugin for exposing a supported MOVA robot vacuum to Apple Home as
a native Matter robotic vacuum cleaner.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an early, community-maintained release. It is not affiliated with or
> endorsed by MOVA. The MOVA cloud interface may change without notice.

## Supported devices

The plugin has been developed and tested with the **MOVA E40 Ultra** using the
device models `mova.vacuum.r9504a` and `mova.vacuum.r5732a`.

The **MOVA Z70 Ultra Roller Complete** with the device model
`mova.vacuum.r5766q` is enabled as well. It is expected to use the same MOVA
cloud properties, commands and map format as the E40 Ultra, but this has not
yet been confirmed by the plugin author with real hardware. Supervise the
first runs. Roller-specific station features such as roller washing
temperature or drying are not exposed; Apple Home controls start, pause,
return to dock, the three main cleaning modes and room selection. Please
report problems with a sanitized log.

Other `mova.vacuum.*` models are detected but remain disabled by default until
their commands have been confirmed with real hardware. See
[Testing another MOVA model](#testing-another-mova-model) to help add one.

## Features

- Native Matter robotic vacuum cleaner in Apple Home
- Start cleaning, pause, resume and return to the dock
- Live operational and battery status
- Three clear cleaning modes: vacuum, mop, and vacuum and mop
- Selection of one or multiple rooms from the saved MOVA map

## Requirements

- Homebridge 2.0 or later with Matter support
- Node.js 22 or later
- A supported MOVA vacuum connected to a MOVAhome account
- An active internet connection to the MOVA cloud

## Installation

Install **Homebridge MOVA** from the Homebridge UI, or install it from npm:

```shell
npm install -g homebridge-mova
```

## Configuration

Use the Homebridge plugin settings and enter:

- **Name:** the name of the integration in Homebridge
- **MOVA email address:** the address used by the MOVAhome app
- **MOVA password:** the password for the MOVAhome account
- **MOVA cloud region:** the cloud used by the account; defaults to `eu`
- **MOVA account country:** the two-letter country code used in MOVAhome;
  required for non-EU regions, defaults to `DE` only when omitted in EU
- **MOVA cloud request language:** `auto`, `en`, `de` or `fr`; this controls
  request metadata, not the Homebridge UI or Apple Home language
- **Unknown MOVA model support:** leave disabled for tested devices; use the
  read-only diagnostic mode when helping to add a new model

Equivalent configuration:

```json
{
  "platform": "MovaVacuum",
  "name": "MOVA",
  "username": "your-mova-email@example.com",
  "password": "your-mova-password"
}
```

Run the plugin as a child bridge. The recommended setup is **Matter
externals-only mode** with HAP disabled. In the stored bridge configuration,
`matter.enabled` is `false`, `matter.externalsOnly` is `true` and `hap.enabled`
is `false`. The vacuum requires its own Matter node, so this avoids publishing
an additional empty bridge and the associated Homebridge warning.

Restart Homebridge after saving the configuration. Homebridge publishes the
vacuum as a separate external Matter accessory. Open the plugin actions and
select **External Accessories** to display the vacuum's Matter QR code. Add the
code labelled with the vacuum's name to Apple Home rather than a generic
child-bridge code.

Homebridge may display **Matter not enabled** for the MOVA child bridge in this
configuration. This is expected: the child bridge's own Matter node is disabled,
while the external Matter vacuum remains active.

### Regional login

Existing configurations without regional options retain the working EU/Germany
defaults. Select the region and country belonging to your **MOVAhome account**,
not the location of the Homebridge host. Use the same credentials that work in
MOVAhome; a Dreame account or a social-login-only account may use a different
authentication flow.

Available cloud identifiers are `eu`, `us`, `sg`, `cn` and `ru`. These choices
come from community implementations; **only EU/Germany has been tested with
this plugin**. Other regions, country combinations and authentication flows
remain experimental. Region selection alone does not verify a robot model.

For a Canadian account, the proposed starting configuration for testing is
**US cloud (`us`), account country `CA`, language `en`**:

```json
{
  "platform": "MovaVacuum",
  "name": "MOVA",
  "username": "your-mova-email@example.com",
  "password": "your-mova-password",
  "region": "us",
  "country": "CA",
  "language": "en",
  "experimentalModelSupport": "diagnostic"
}
```

This is a test configuration, **not confirmation that Canadian accounts or the
V50 are compatible**. Keep an unverified model in diagnostic mode first.
Restart the MOVA child bridge after saving. Do not move your account to another
country in the MOVAhome app or reset/re-pair your robot to test this setting.

The selected region is used consistently for login, device discovery, device
requests and map URL requests. The country and language are also applied to
the login form and encrypted regional header. `auto` preserves the historical
EU/DE combination (German request language, English regional-header language);
other account combinations use English. An explicit `en`, `de` or `fr` uses
that language in both places. The configuration form is in English; existing
German operational log messages and fallback room labels are not translated
by this setting.

There is no automatic search across regions and no automatic retry of a failed
login. An authenticated API request rejected with HTTP 401/403 may trigger one
re-login and one request retry on the **same** server, as before. Login and
authenticated API requests do not follow redirects carrying credentials.

### Updating from 0.1.0

Version 1.0.0 changes the Homebridge registration from an accessory plugin to a
platform plugin so Matter can run inside a child bridge. Remove the old
`"accessory": "MovaVacuum"` configuration before installing the update, then
create the MOVA configuration again through the Homebridge UI. Do not copy an
old password from logs or support messages; enter the current password directly
in the protected password field.

Never include your MOVA password, Matter pairing code or complete Homebridge
configuration in an issue or support request.

## Testing another MOVA model

If the account contains an unverified `mova.vacuum.*` model, the plugin logs
its model identifier and a link to the new-model request form. For a known
candidate, it also logs the matching product name. Unverified models are never
enabled automatically.

Start with **Safe diagnostic mode**. It reads the model's existing status and
room count but sends no control commands and publishes no Matter accessory.
The resulting sanitized report contains no MOVA credentials, account details,
device identifier, custom device name or room names.

Attach that report to a
[new MOVA model request](https://github.com/Gh0str1s3n/homebridge-mova/issues/new?template=new-mova-model.yml).
Only use **Experimental full access** when you understand that the model's
commands have not been verified by the plugin author. Test start, pause,
resume, return to dock and each cleaning mode one at a time before requesting
that the model be added to the tested list.

## Room selection

When a saved MOVA map is available, its rooms are exposed through Matter's
Service Area feature. Select one or more rooms in Apple Home before starting
the vacuum. Starting without a room selection performs a complete cleaning.

Apple Home displays **Vacuum**, **Mop**, and **Vacuum and Mop**. The selected
mode is applied uniformly to every selected room. Deep cleaning and automatic
per-room cleaning are intentionally not exposed because Apple Home groups
those options in a way that makes the effective cleaning behavior unclear.

## Troubleshooting

If the vacuum does not appear, check the Homebridge log for the MOVA cloud
connection, the selected device model and Matter publication. The Homebridge
host and the Apple Home hub must be reachable on the same local network for
Matter commissioning.

When reporting a problem, include the Homebridge version, Node.js version,
MOVA model identifier and relevant sanitized log lines.

### Login fails with HTTP 401/403

First check that the account signs in successfully in MOVAhome, then check
the plugin's account region and country. A 401 is not proof of a wrong password:
an incorrect region or an unsupported region-specific authentication flow can
also be responsible. Stop retrying if MOVA reports an attempt limit or lockout.

Cloud failures include a compact `MOVA cloud diagnostic:` JSON object with
the operation, configured region/country/language, HTTP status or known network
error code, and a restricted subset of API error fields. For example:

```json
{
  "operation": "login",
  "region": "us",
  "country": "CA",
  "language": "en",
  "rlcLanguage": "en",
  "httpStatus": 401,
  "networkCode": "ERR_BAD_REQUEST",
  "api": {
    "error": "invalid_user",
    "error_description": "username or password error"
  }
}
```

This is an illustrative example, not a real account report. The diagnostic
keeps only numeric/recognized error codes, recognized generic error messages,
bounded attempt counters and a success flag. Unknown text is replaced with
`[redacted]`; arbitrary response fields and nested objects are omitted. Raw
Axios errors, request bodies/headers, tokens and signed map URLs are not logged.
Errors returned with HTTP 200 but without an access token are handled too.

If login still fails, share **only this diagnostic object**, your plugin
version and selected account settings in a support request. Check it before
posting. Do not share the full log or raw MOVA response: normal operation can
log device/room names and Homebridge itself can log pairing codes. A cloud
diagnostic is available even when login fails before model discovery.

## Privacy

The configured credentials are used by the plugin to sign in to the MOVA
cloud. The plugin author does not operate an intermediary service and does not
collect analytics or account data.

Cloud-error diagnostics are logged locally by Homebridge and are not sent to
the plugin author automatically. They deliberately include your configured
country and region, but no account credentials or device identifiers.

## Credits

Regional cloud identifiers are based on the
[F1nn-T/dreame-ha MOVA configuration flow](https://github.com/F1nn-T/dreame-ha/blob/main/custom_components/dreame_mower/config_flow.py).
The US MOVA endpoint is also documented in this
[independent MOVA P10 protocol analysis](https://canitrustthat.com/teardowns/reverse-engineering-mova-p10-vacuum/).
These sources inform experimental routing, not a compatibility guarantee.

The unverified model candidate catalogue is based on community research from
[F1nn-T/dreame-ha](https://github.com/F1nn-T/dreame-ha). No compatibility is
inferred from that list; every model still requires safe testing with this
plugin before it can join the supported-device list.
