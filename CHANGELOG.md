# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Enable the MOVA Z70 Ultra Roller Complete (`mova.vacuum.r5766q`) without
  experimental model support; it is expected to use the same cloud
  properties, commands and map format as the MOVA E40 Ultra (hardware
  confirmation pending)
- Keep the MOVA Z70 Pro (`mova.vacuum.r5766`) and other Z70 variants as
  unverified candidates

## 1.2.0-beta.2 - 2026-08-31

- Add configurable MOVA cloud region, account country and request language
- Apply regional settings to login, encrypted regional metadata, device
  discovery, commands and both saved/active map URL requests
- Preserve existing EU/Germany defaults; require an account country for other
  regions and reject unsupported configuration before making network requests
- Add allowlisted cloud-error diagnostics, including HTTP 401/403, login
  responses without a token, command errors and map-download failures, without
  exposing raw responses, credentials, account/device data or signed URLs
- Disable redirects for credential-bearing requests; never probe other regions
- Provide English configuration labels, Canadian account testing instructions
  and region/login fields in the model-support form
- Add mocked HTTP and platform tests for regional routing, privacy, bounded
  reauthentication and read-only diagnostics; no live hardware commands
- Canadian accounts and non-EU login flows remain unverified pending tester
  feedback; no additional models are promoted to tested support

## 1.2.0-beta.1 - 2026-08-26

- Add a sourced catalogue of known but unverified MOVA vacuum model variants
- Show the likely product name in the Homebridge log when a catalogue match is
  detected
- Keep every catalogue candidate disabled by default and behind the existing
  safe diagnostic and explicit experimental-access controls
- Add automated checks for duplicate identifiers and accidental overlap with
  the tested MOVA E40 Ultra models

## 1.2.0-beta.0 - 2026-08-25

- Detect previously unknown MOVA vacuum model identifiers
- Add a safe read-only diagnostic mode that sends no control commands and
  publishes no Matter accessory
- Generate a sanitized compatibility report without credentials, device IDs,
  custom device names or room names
- Add an explicit experimental full-access mode for community hardware tests
- Add a GitHub issue form for requesting and documenting support for a new
  MOVA model

## 1.0.1 - 2026-08-25

- Limit Apple Home to the three unambiguous main modes: Vacuum, Mop, and
  Vacuum and Mop
- Keep single-room and multi-room selection through Matter Service Area
- Remove Deep Clean and Automatic per-room cleaning from Apple Home
- Normalize previously active optional MOVA modes to Vacuum and Mop so Matter
  never reports an unsupported mode

## 1.0.1-beta.4 - 2026-08-25

- Present Vacuum, Mop, Vacuum and Mop, Deep Clean and Automatic per-room
  cleaning as five independent choices in Apple Home
- Remove the misleading Automatic checkmark below Vacuum and Mop
- Keep the selected mode synchronized with the cleaning mode reported by MOVA

## 1.0.1-beta.3 - 2026-08-25

- Keep Vacuum, Mop and Vacuum and Mop as the three persistent main modes
- Treat Automatic and Deep Clean as explicitly selected options for the next
  cleaning run instead of inheriting MOVA's stored option while idle
- Return Apple Home to neutral Vacuum and Mop after an optional cleaning run
  finishes or the vacuum is sent back to the station

## 1.0.1-beta.2 - 2026-08-24

- Let the vacuum apply its own saved per-room cleaning settings after it has
  confirmed customized cleaning mode
- Do not block room cleaning when the live map object is unavailable through
  the MOVA cloud

## 1.0.1-beta.1 - 2026-08-24

- Read individual room settings from the active MOVA map because saved map
  listings intentionally omit customized cleaning data
- Merge current cleaning settings with the stable room names and identifiers
  from the saved map

## 1.0.1-beta.0 - 2026-08-24

- Preserve the individual MOVA cleaning mode, suction level, water volume and
  repeat count for every room selected in Apple Home's Automatic mode
- Wait for the vacuum to confirm customized cleaning before a room run starts
- Prevent automatic room cleaning when the saved map lacks safe per-room mode
  data
- Add automated tests for MOVA map decoding and mixed room-cleaning plans

## 1.0.0 - 2026-08-23

- First stable release
- Native Matter robotic vacuum support for Apple Home
- Homebridge platform registration for Matter-compatible child bridges
- External-only Matter publication with HAP disabled
- Start, pause, resume and return-to-dock commands
- Live operating state and battery updates
- Vacuum, mop, combined and sequential cleaning modes
- Single-room and multi-room selection from the saved MOVA map
- Support for MOVA E40 Ultra models `mova.vacuum.r9504a` and
  `mova.vacuum.r5732a`
